  technical: 'This project runs on Node.js and is hosted on Heroku. The front-end is created using Pug.js and is rendered directly on the Heroku dyno. Users have their passwords encrypted using Bcrypt authentication which keeps the application secure. The heart of the application uses Cheerio.js to pull down the HTML off the Zillow web page and jQuery to extract the desired elements. A throttle was used to slow down the request to the web page. The listings, filters, and user information is stored in a PostgreSQL database. Node Mailer automates the sending of text messages via Google\'s SMTP client.',

Canvas is used to plot the data from local storage once the scoreboard is populated. The competitive game mode algorithm was written by myself and mirrors how I would approach playing a game in real life. Lastly, the colors of the pieces and the line indicating a win are constructed from manipulating the color and rotation of SVG files. The front-end is hosted on Netlify and the back-end is hosted on Heroku.',
